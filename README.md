## PA0 - The night before the world was born: configuration

### Add ssh key on github

```shell
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "1927553272@qq.com"
# copy the content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into Github.
```

### Why do I get an error when I run 'make menuconfig' in the terminal?

We are missing the bison and flex libraries, so we run the following commands.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install bison
$ sudo apt-get install flex
```

## PA1 - The opening chapter: the simplest computer

### Select your role

Here I choose **riscv-32**.

### We cannot get the right end when we first 'make run'

The error is in ``/ics2024/nemu/src/monitor/monitor.c``. We can just comment it out.

```c
// ics2024/nemu/src/monitor/monitor.c
static void welcome() {
  ...
  // Log("Exercise: Please remove me in the source code and compile NEMU again.");
  // assert(0);
}
```

### What is cpu_exec(-1) ?

**cpu_exec(uint64_t n)** is used to control the number of instructions executed by CPU. In C, when -1 is converted to **unsigned long int** type, the value becomes a very large number $2^{64} -1$.

Thus, `cpu_exec(-1)` will allow the program to execute as many instructions as possible until some other condition (e.g., NEMU_END, NEMU_ABORT, NEMU_QUIT) is triggered and the program is stopped.

### Is cpu_exec(-1) an undefined behavior?

Taking -1 as an argument does **not** result in undefined behavior. It causes n to be converted to the maximum value of type uint64_t. This is legal and well defined behavior in the C99 standard.

Reference: [C99 standard - chapter 6.3.1.3](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~daespino/files/Iso_C_1999_definition.pdf)

### Why do we need nemu_trap?

nemu_trap is used to **catch exceptions or traps** that occur in a program. It simulates the behavior of the hardware when it encounters an error and ensures that the program responds correctly when an exception occurs, such as reporting an error, terminating the program, or entering debug mode.

### Why do we need monitor?

Monitor provides **interactive debugging features** that allow users to control program execution, view program status, set breakpoints, and more.

### Why do we need '\n' in printf() ?

Line breaks '\n' are used to ensure that the output is formatted to display properly, and to maintain clear separation between multiple outputs.

### Where is selector in i386 (just find its location)?

[i386 - chapter 5.1.3](https://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2013/readings/i386.pdf)

### What are the command formats for riscv-32?

### What is the behavior of the LUI command?

LUI (load upper immediate) is used to build 32-bit constants and uses the U-type format. LUI places the U-immediate value in the top 20 bits of the destination register rd, filling in the lowest 12 bits with zeros.

### What is the structure of the mstatus register?

The mstatus register is a read/write register formatted as shown in the following figures for riscv-32 and riscv-64. The mstatus register keeps track of and controls the current operating state of the hart.

Machine-mode status register (mstatus) for riscv-32:

### How to get the total number of lines of code for all .c and .h and files in the nemu directory?

```shell
cd $NEMU_HOME
find -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" | xargs wc -l

# If you want to ignore all blank lines, you can run the following command.
find -name "*.c" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -v '^\s*$' | wc -l
```

### How many lines of code did you write in PA1 compared to the framework code?

```shell
git diff --stat pa0..pa1
```

### What do -Wall and -Werror do in gcc?

-Wall: turn on **common warnings** to help developers find potential problems.

-Werror: **treat all warnings as errors** and force developers to fix them to ensure code quality.

### Issue

* ~~cmd_d: I don't actually return the watchpoints to free_, and I just left it **unused**.~~
  * I have recycled watchpoints when cmd_d.
  * But I haven't sorted free_ yet.
* ~~info w: I output watchpoints in reverse order, which doesn't really fit gdb in terms of output style.~~
  * I have sorted the display information in set_wp.
* ~~trace_and_difftest(): Although I implemented a cyclic scan of watchpoints, I did not create the macro CONFIG_WATCHPOINT.~~
  * I have created the macro CONFIG_WATCHPOINT..

## PA2 - Simple complex machines: Von Neumann computer system

### How does YEMU execute a program?

```c
while (1) {
  /* fetch   */
  opcode = inst.[type].[op];
  switch (opcode) {
    case ...:
      /* decode  */
      /* execute */
      break;
  }
  /* update  */
}
```

### How RISCV-32 encodes 32-bit constants directly into an instruction?

riscv-32 use **2 steps** to accomplish loading command. Firstly, riscv-32 uses `lui` to load the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit constant and place them in a register while padding the lower 12 bits with zeros. Secondly, riscv-32 uses `addi` to add the remaining lower 12 bits of the immediate number to the register.

```assembly
# pseudo-instruction: li t0, 0x12345678
lui t0, 0x12345
addi t0, t0, 0x678
```

### Why is an error message output when an unimplemented instruction is executed?

When an unimplemented instruction is executed, it enters the function `INV(s->pc)`

```c
// nemu/src/isa/riscv32/inst.c
static int decode_exec(Decode *s) {
  INSTPAT_START();
  /* some implemented instruction */
  INSTPAT("??????? ????? ????? ??? ????? ????? ??", inv    , N, INV(s->pc));
  INSTPAT_END();
}

// nemu/include/cpu/cpu.h
void invalid_inst(vaddr_t thispc);
#define INV(thispc) invalid_inst(thispc)

// nemu/src/engine/interpreter/hostcall.c
void invalid_inst(vaddr_t thispc) {
  /* print out some error information with isa logo */
  set_nemu_state(NEMU_ABORT, thispc, -1);
}
```

After outputing the error message, riscv-32 will set nemu state as `NEMU_ABORT`. Then the system will stop.

### RV32M standard extension

When we implement DIV[U] and REM[U], we need to consider some edge conditions.

|    Condition    |  Dividend  | Divisor |    DIVU   | REMU |     DIV    | REM |
|:---------------:|:----------:|:-------:|:---------:|:----:|:----------:|:---:|
| Division by zero|      x     |     0   | $2^{L}-1$ |   x  |     -1     |  x  |
| Overflow        | $-2^{L-1}$ |    -1   |     -     |   -  | $-2^{L-1}$ |  0  |

### Running NEMU in batch mode

When testing, we can set some arguments in Makefile so we don't need to type 'c' and 'q':

```makefile
# abstract-machine/scripts/platform/nemu.mk
NEMUFLAGS += --batch
```

### Disappeared symbol

```c
// am-kernels/tests/cpu-tests/tests/add.c
int add(int a, int b) {
	int c = a + b;
	return c;
}
#define NR_DATA LENGTH(test_data)
```

We define the macro "NR_DATA", and we also define the local variable c and the formal parameters "a" and "b", but we can't find them in the symbol table. Why?

The macro is defined via the preprocessor with the value `LENGTH(test_data)`. During the preprocessing phase before compilation, the macro has been replaced with a specific value.

Local variables and function arguments are not recorded in the symbol table because they don't need to be accessed across functions or files.

### What constitutes a symbol?

A symbol is an entity in a program that can be referenced by name. It usually consists of the following:

* global variables
* static variables
* functions
* special symbols generated by the compiler (e.g., `.text`, `.data`)


### Where is "Hello World!" in the string table?

Write a "Hello World" program under Linux, compile it and find the string table of the ELF file by the above method, where do you find the "Hello World!" string in the string table? Why is it there?

After writing hello.c:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

Run the following commands and we can get the result:

```shell
gcc -g -o hello hello.c
readelf -x .rodata hello

# result
Hex dump of section '.rodata':
  0x00002000 01000200 48656c6c 6f20576f 726c6421 ....Hello World!
  0x00002010 00  
```

In C, string constants (such as "Hello, World!") are stored as **read-only global data**. The compiler puts string constants into **.rodata** sections to save memory and to ensure that they are not modifiable (read-only property). 

.strtab is specialized for storing symbol-related names (e.g., function names, variable names). "Hello, World!" is a string constant not directly related to a symbol, so it is not stored in .strtab.

### Duplicated symbol table

Write a "Hello World" program under Linux, and then use `strip` command to discard the symbol table in the executable. View the hello infomation using `readelf`:

```shell
gcc -o hello hello.c
strip -s hello
readelf -a hello
```

We'll notice that the symbol table has been discarded, so will the hello program run successfully? **Yes**

There is also a symbol table in the target file, which we can discard as well. View the hello infomation using `readelf`, and we'll find that symbol table is discarded. Try to Trying to link to hello.o:

```shell
gcc -c hello.c
strip -s hello.o
gcc -o hello hello.o

# result
/usr/bin/ld: error in hello.o(.eh_frame); no .eh_frame_hdr table will be created
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function `_start':
(.text+0x1b): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

Try to compare the two situations and analyze the reasons.

* Scenario 1: symbol table of the executable file is discarded
  * Symbol table is important for debugging and disassembly, but at runtime, they are already resolved to specific addresses by the linker, so the program can still run after removing the symbol table from the executable file.
* Scenario 2: symbol table fo target file is discarded
  * **The target file relies on the symbol table at linking time**, which contains global symbols and unresolved external references (e.g, main function). `strip -s` removes the symbol table from hello.o, making it impossible for the target file to provide the necessary symbol information. During the linking phase, the linker needs to resolve the symbol for `main` from the target file but since the symbol table has been removed, the linker cannot find the definition of `main`, resulting in an error.

### Issue

* RISC-V instruction tests: I haven't used those test sets
  * ~~[riscv-tests-am](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/riscv-tests-am)~~
  * [riscv-arch-test-am](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/riscv-arch-test-am)
* Spike doesn't support unaligned accesses
  * Executing an unaligned access instruction in Spike will throw an exception and make PC jump to 0. However, NEMU doesn't implement such a feature, so if you let NEMU and Spike execute such an instruction at the same time, DiffTest will report an error.
* Capture dead loop
  * When the program is trapped in a dead loop, let the user program pause, and output the corresponding prompt message.
* Implement stdio.h klib
  * I haven't implement stdio.h function fully.
* Real Time Clock
  * I haven't implement AM_TIMER_RTC.
* Detect multiple keys being pressed at the same time
  * I have an idea to define `static int key_states[128] = {0};` to store the key status.
* Audio (optional)
  * This code is copied and the reference is below:
  * https://github.com/nops1ed/Nemu_Riscv32/blob/pa3/abstract-machine/am/src/platform/nemu/ioe/audio.c
  * https://github.com/nops1ed/Nemu_Riscv32/blob/pa3/nemu/src/device/audio.c
  * https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook/ics2024/2.5.html#%E5%A3%B0%E5%8D%A1
  * I need to understand how the author implement it.

## PA3 - Journey through time: batch system

### Issue

* Exception response mechanism in DIFFTEST
  * In riscv-32, we need to set `mstatus` as 0x1800
* ~~Detect ISA type in ELF file~~
  * If we use `native` to load 'dummy' in `riscv32`, it will be defined as an undefined behavior, which may happen some errors. We need to detect the ISA type in `loader.c`.
* SYS_write
  * This is not a complete syscall, and it should be encapsulated.
